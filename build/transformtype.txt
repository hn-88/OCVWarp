The transform type parameter in OCVWarp.ini can have the following values.

0  for EquirectTo360Fisheye
1  for EquirectTo180Fisheye
2  for 360FisheyeToEquirect
3  for 180FisheyeToEquirect
4  for 180Fisheye (fulldome) to warped file similar to TGAWarp at http://paulbourke.net/dome/tgawarp/ - this requires a map file similar to the included EP_xyuv_1920.map.
5  for Equirect to warped file - equivalent to doing 1 followed by 4


Equirect stands for Equirectangular 360 projected images that have the full 360 degree x 180 degree view (2:1 ratio)
